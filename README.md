## Overview

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a sophisticated network security solution designed to protect your network infrastructure against unauthorized access, suspicious activities, and potential security threats. Leveraging Python and a range of robust libraries, this system offers real-time monitoring, intelligent threat detection, and customizable alerts to enhance your network's security posture.

## Features

- **Real-time Network Monitoring:** Continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious behavior.
- **Advanced Threat Detection:** Identifies common attack patterns, including SYN floods, port scanning, ping sweeping, bruteforce and data exfiltration.
- **Flexible Alerting:** Provides customizable alerts and notifications to keep you informed.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily extend and customize detection methods to adapt to evolving threats.
